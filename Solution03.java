/*1450. Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time

Given two integer arrays startTime and endTime and given an integer queryTime.

The ith student started doing their homework at the time startTime[i] and finished it at time endTime[i].

Return the number of students doing their homework at time queryTime. More formally, return the number of students where queryTime lays in the interval [startTime[i], endTime[i]] inclusive.

 

Example 1:

Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: We have 3 students where:
The first student started doing homework at time 1 and finished at time 3 and wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The second student started doing homework at time 2 and finished at time 2 and also wasn't doing anything at time 4.
The third student started doing homework at time 3 and finished at time 7 and was the only student doing homework at time 4.
Example 2:

Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: The only student was doing their homework at the queryTime.*/


class Solution {
    public int busyStudent(int[] startTime, int[] endTime, int queryTime) {
        int ans = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<startTime.length;i++){
            if(startTime[i] <= queryTime && endTime[i] >= queryTime){
                ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
